	His friends loved his new bag.
	Soon, his bike bag was in great demand.
	Reich quit his job, and started his own business-Alchemy Goods.
	At first, he depended on his friends for inner tubes.
	But business was good, and he quickly ran short of these tubes.
    </p>
    <p id="font2">
    He needed a new supply.
	So he asked local bike stores to send him used inner tubes instead of throwing them away.
	To date, he has used over 300,000 inner tubes.
	Having a good supply of these materials is a critical part of Reich's business.

    <p id="font3">
    Each bag uses as many recycled products as possible.
	The straps, for example, are old car seat belts.
	Reich's goal is to use 100 percent recycled materials.
	This is not easy.
	"It's hard to come up with a product that is endlessly recycled.
	We're a step ahead, but we're not perfect."
	He wants to let his customers know about his goal, so each bag has a number above the company logo.
	The number gives the percentage of recycled materials in that particular bag.
